**Bindings to Tcl/Tk for the D programming language**

---

## Supported platforms
These bindings have only been tested on Linux, developed with DMD v2.064.2. Other compilers have not been tested but should build fine.

## Compiler flags

### Required
You will need to pass linker flags to the compiler to link to the neccessary Tcl and Tk libraries when using these bindings.
